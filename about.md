<p>As a Master's student in Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, I am passionate about leveraging biotechnology for human health. Currently engaged in groundbreaking research at Hiller Lab (CMU), my focus is on nanotechnology and bacterial pathogenesis.</p>

<p>I am a part of project involving extracellular vesicles (EVs) functionalized with targeting peptides, specifically designed for pneumococcus species. This work explores the impact on competence and virulence, offering insights into therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>With a background in content writing for The Science Vista, I've communicated complex biotech concepts to a broader audience. My articles span topics such as cancer biology, synthetic biology, and emerging trends in the biotech sector. Eager to contribute to biotech and pharmaceutical innovation, my goal is to address global challenges through the transformative potential of biotechnology. Always ready for new challenges and learning opportunities, I am dedicated to advancing the frontiers of this dynamic field. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together! </p>
