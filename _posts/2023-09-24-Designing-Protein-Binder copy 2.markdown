 While working for Center for Bioscience and nanoscience research , I worked under Dr. Ragunathan to identify and quantify the antimicrobial property in Rosa indica plant. 
 <br>
This project focused on the identification and purification of antimicrobial compounds found within Rosa indica leaves. Utilizing a combination of wet-lab molecular techniques such as UV spectrometry and immunological assays like ELISA and immunoprecipitation, our aim was to isolate effective antimicrobial agents. Testing the minimum inhibitory concentration at the Centre for Bioscience and Nanoscience Research (CBNR), we sought to understand the potency of these compounds against various bacteria strains. Through meticulous experimentation and validation processes, we achieved a remarkable 56% efficiency in targeting gram-positive bacteria and a notable 65% increase in efficiency against gram-negative bacteria. Our efforts were meticulously documented, ensuring comprehensive records of all experiments and upholding impeccable standards in managing chemical inventories, waste disposal, and equipment calibration. Collaboration with industry experts ensured the validation and contextualization of our findings, aligning them with current industry standards and enhancing the relevance of our research in the field of antimicrobial development.
