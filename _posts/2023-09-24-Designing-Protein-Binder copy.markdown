Increase in Secondary metabolite production using Streptomyces species. I did this project at PSG College of Arts and Science, Coimbatore, India. Streptomycin, a vital antibiotic produced by Streptomyces species, plays a pivotal role in combating bacterial infections. However, challenges such as low yields and production costs hinder its widespread availability. Our project aims to increase streptomycin production through metabolic engineering in both Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces griseus, offering a sustainable solution to address the demand for this life-saving antibiotic

**Our objective:** 
Our objective  is to investigate the impact of physical stress, specifically mechanical agitation, on secondary metabolite production in Streptomyces cultures. By subjecting the cultures to controlled mechanical stress, we aim to stimulate secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways and increase the yields of valuable compounds.
<br>
**Methods:**
Our approach involves the following methodologies:
Cultivation of Streptomyces cultures under standard conditions, followed by the application of controlled mechanical stress at specific time points during the fermentation process.
Optimization of agitation parameters including frequency, amplitude, and duration to determine the optimal stress conditions for enhancing secondary metabolite production and activating biosynthesis pathway.
Analysis of secondary metabolite profiles using Staining techniques to perform growth analysis and used chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques to quantify changes in metabolite yields in response to mechanical stress.
Comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the stress-induced enhancement of secondary metabolite production.
