Secondary metabolite production using Streptomyces species. I did this project at PSG College of Arts and Science, Coimbatore, India. Streptomycin, a vital antibiotic produced by Streptomyces species, plays a pivotal role in combating bacterial infections. However, challenges such as low yields and production costs hinder its widespread availability. Our project aims to increase streptomycin production through metabolic engineering in both Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces griseus, offering a sustainable solution to address the demand for this life-saving antibiotic
